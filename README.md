# Multiplication Table

Multiplication Table is a cute game designed to practice the multiplication tables. It uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to minimize the time you see different problems. I designed it for my children to practice their multiplication tables so they wouldn't have to count on their fingers well into their middle ages (like their dad).

The game is written in Typescript and uses the DOM for rendering.
